WifiTracker
===========
A spare time project made to satisfy my curiosity: Is it possible to calculate the exact position of a WiFi access point just by moving around in the neighborhood with a smart 
phone?

This app aims to find out. Nothing is tested as of now, and everything is currently in oh-my-god-the-code-is-horrible-in-this-prototype mode. Lots of code is very old.

Goal for the future is to crowdsource detection of wireless APs in every area, helping people find free access points wherever they are.
